At its most basic, this is a tool that ensures inter-document hyperlinks are always correct.

# Big Object Types

We have a few big object types, represented by a prefix:

- S - Stakeholder. Who is using the sytem or cares about its operation.
- U - User Story. A full story of how the system is used.
- F - Functional Requirement. Something the system does.
- R - Non-Functional Requirement. A quality the system needs.
- N - Non-Requirements. Documentation of things agreed to not be in the system.
