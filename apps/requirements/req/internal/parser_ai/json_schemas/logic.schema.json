  "description": "Schema for a logic specification object. Logic objects represent formal or informal specifications used for preconditions (requires), postconditions (guarantees), safety rules, invariants, guards, and derivation policies. A logic object must have a description and may optionally include a formal notation and specification. If validation fails, verify 'description' is present and non-empty.",
