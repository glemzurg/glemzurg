Loose notes:

	// panic(" embedded structured data")

	// traceability in requirements:
	//
	// Scan ever every requirement and use case and functional for stakeholders
	// a stakeholder not mentioned in any use case or requirement
	// functional requirement that is not in a usecase bullet
	// generate a md page matrix view of who cares about what
	// report collisions on ids
	// generate an orginization of aspects but not across types of requirements (only compare apples, to applies)
	// for all sorting: pad numbers with lots of zeros so we sort appropriately
	// this is for aspect values as well
	// report unknown aspects

	// traceabilty inside requirements, add structured data to tracability inside requirements, traceability to a design,
	// distill json of requirements for comparision for design
	// distill json of design for comparison for requriements

	// Incomplete?
	// a requirement aspect aspect with an unknown value
